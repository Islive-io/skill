Very simple chatserver.

## How to
1. Clone the repository.
2. In the root folder, run "npm install".
3. While there, also run "node app".
4. Open "http://hostname:1337" in a sufficiently recent browser.
5. Do your thing, go crazy! Break everything you can.
6. Please provide feedback.

**Note:** No database added as yet. It's on the TODO list, I'll get to it eventually.
